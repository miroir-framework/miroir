# RunActionTracker Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive action tracking system for the Miroir DomainController as requested. The system includes:

1. **RunActionTracker Service** - Tracks action execution with timing and parent-child relationships
2. **Integration with MiroirContext** - Injected through the MiroirContext for global access
3. **RunActionTimeline React Component** - Displays real-time action timeline with filtering
4. **Integration with RootComponent** - Always-visible timeline panel

## Implementation Details

### 1. RunActionTracker Service

**Location**: `packages/miroir-core/src/3_controllers/RunActionTracker.ts`

**Features**:
- Unique ID generation for each action
- Parent-child relationship tracking via action stack
- Start/end time tracking with duration calculation
- Status tracking (running, completed, error)
- Auto-cleanup after 5 minutes
- Subscription mechanism for real-time updates
- Depth calculation for nested actions

**Interface**: `packages/miroir-core/src/0_interfaces/3_controllers/RunActionTrackerInterface.ts`

### 2. MiroirContext Integration

**Updated Files**:
- `packages/miroir-core/src/0_interfaces/3_controllers/MiroirContextInterface.ts`
- `packages/miroir-core/src/3_controllers/MiroirContext.ts`

The RunActionTracker is now injected through the MiroirContext, making it accessible throughout the application via `context.miroirContext.runActionTracker`.

### 3. DomainController Integration

**Updated File**: `packages/miroir-core/src/3_controllers/DomainController.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Added `trackAction()` helper method for wrapping action execution
- Modified `handleAction()` to use action tracking
- Modified `handleCompositeAction()` to use action tracking
- Automatic parent-child relationship tracking when `handleCompositeAction` calls `handleAction`

### 4. RunActionTimeline React Component

**Location**: `packages/miroir-standalone-app/src/miroir-fwk/4_view/components/RunActionTimeline.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Real-time updates** via subscription to RunActionTracker
- **Always-visible** fixed position panel on the right side
- **Hierarchical display** showing parent-child relationships with indentation
- **Status indicators** with icons (running, completed, error)
- **Filtering capabilities**:
  - By action type
  - By status (running, completed, error)
  - By minimum duration
  - By time range
- **Action details** including start time, end time, duration, and error messages
- **Collapsible tree structure** for nested actions
- **Responsive design** with proper Material-UI theming

### 5. RootComponent Integration

**Updated File**: `packages/miroir-standalone-app/src/miroir-fwk/4_view/components/Page/RootComponent.tsx`

The RunActionTimeline component is now rendered as an always-visible panel in the RootComponent, positioned on the right side of the screen.

## Export Updates

**Updated File**: `packages/miroir-core/src/index.ts`

Added exports for:
- `RunActionTrackerInterface`
- `ActionTrackingData` 
- `RunActionTracker`

## How It Works

1. **Action Start**: When any action is executed through DomainController, `trackAction()` is called
2. **Unique ID**: A unique tracking ID is generated and the action is added to the tracker
3. **Parent-Child**: If an action is called from within another action (e.g., handleCompositeAction â†’ handleAction), the parent relationship is automatically established
4. **Real-time Updates**: The React component subscribes to tracker changes and updates the UI in real-time
5. **Visual Feedback**: Users can see:
   - Which actions are currently running
   - How long actions take to complete
   - The hierarchy of nested actions
   - Any errors that occur
6. **Auto-cleanup**: Actions older than 5 minutes are automatically removed to prevent memory issues

## Testing

The implementation is ready for testing. The development server runs on `http://localhost:5174/` and the RunActionTimeline should be visible on the right side of the screen. When you perform any actions through the DomainController (like loading data, committing changes, etc.), you should see them appear in the timeline with real-time updates.

## Configuration

The system includes several configurable parameters:
- **Cleanup interval**: 1 minute (can be adjusted in RunActionTracker constructor)
- **Max age**: 5 minutes (can be adjusted in RunActionTracker constructor)
- **Timeline position**: Fixed right side (can be adjusted in RunActionTimeline component)
- **Filtering options**: Fully customizable through the UI

## Performance Considerations

- In-memory storage only (as requested)
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Efficient subscription mechanism
- Memoized React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Throttled updates for smooth UI performance

The implementation is complete and ready for use!
