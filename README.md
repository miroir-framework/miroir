## An end-to-end, low-code, agentic development platform for data-centric applications.


⚠️ *We're in "early adopter" phase, documentation is insufficient, and things will break!* ⚠️
---

## Miroir in a few Words

Miroir is a comprehensive development framework that transforms how you create web applications by:

- **adopting a data-centric approach** - you start by **describing the concepts** manipulated by your application, then Miroir helps you create your application around these concepts (**creating business logic**, **testing**, **scripting**, transferring data, etc.)
- **providing end-to-end support** - in Miroir, described concepts and business logic become alive as Graphical User Interfaces (webapp **GUI**), APIs (**Rest**), and **database schemas**, end-to-end!
- **enabling low-code description** - in Miroir the business logic is defined as **block-like** elements, not as code; these elements can be combined, modified and tested interactively, all at run-time.
- **supporting AI agents** - business logic written in Miroir can automatically be exposed to AI agents using the **Model Context Protocol** (MCP)

<!-- - **Unifying development and runtime** - Define concepts once, use everywhere (database, API, UI, business logic)
- **Enabling low-code creation** - Build and modify applications at runtime without recompilation
- **Supporting AI agents** - Native Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for natural language development
- **Fostering domain languages** - Create custom Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for your business domain -->

## Example use case

You need to manage a small library inventory, with Books, Authors, Publishers and Members, where the Members may borrow and return Books under given conditions. Using Miroir, you may typically:

- **install Miroir on a laptop** - the Miroir desktop app is made available on a single machine in the library, perfect for a nascent inventory
- **create the wanted entities** - start creating you application in Miroir by creating Book, Author, Publisher and Member entities, each Entity defining potential relations to others (for example a Book must have 1 or more Authors)
- **create the wanted operations** - typically, there would be an action for a Member to **borrow a Book**, with a verification of the necessary conditions to allow the operation, and also an action to **return a borrowed Book**.
- **create additional views** - for example to **monitor the inventory state, popularity of Books**, punctuality of Users, etc.
- **create (non-regression) tests** - evolve your application safely, ensuring that improvements do not break existing features
- **evolve to a full-blown web application** - when a second computer arrives at the library, **deploy your existing application on a third-party server** and access it from anywhere via a web browser!

<!-- ### Key Features

✨ **Schema-First Development** - Define your data model using Jzod (Miroir Meta-Language), generate TypeScript types, Zod validators, and database schemas automatically

🔄 **Write Once, Run Anywhere** - Business logic (Queries, Transformers, Actions) runs on client, server, or in-database (SQL)

🗄️ **Multi-Store Support** - PostgreSQL, IndexedDB (browser), or filesystem - switch without code changes

📊 **Declarative UI** - Define Reports and Runners using JSON, no React code required

🤖 **AI-Ready** - Built-in MCP server for LLM-driven development with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI agents

🧪 **Test-Driven** - Integrated testing framework with development/runtime parity -->

## Who Is Miroir For?

### 🎯 Start Small, Scale Seamlessly

**Problem**: You need a quick data management solution. A spreadsheet works today, but what about tomorrow when requirements grow?

**Solution**: Start with Miroir's low-code interface, then seamlessly add complexity as needs evolve - automated testing, version control, multi-user access, production deployment.

### 💼 Common Use Cases

| User Profile | Use Case | Miroir Benefits |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Citizen Developer** | Internal tools, data tracking apps | No-code/low-code creation, instant feedback |
| **Software Engineer** | Business applications, APIs, dashboards | Reduce boilerplate by 80%, rapid prototyping |
| **Data Analyst** | Custom reporting, data transformation | SQL-free queries, visual report builder |
| **IT Manager** | Internal applications portfolio | Faster delivery, easier maintenance |
| **Startup Founder** | MVP development | Quick iteration, AI-assisted development | -->

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) PostgreSQL 14+ for database persistence
- (Optional) Git for version control

### Installation
### Installing Node.js

If Node.js is not already installed, download the LTS version (18 or higher) from:
https://nodejs.org

After installation, verify it by running:
node -v
npm -v

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/miroir-framework/miroir.git
cd miroir

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build core packages
npm run devBuild -w miroir-core
npm run build -w miroir-localcache-redux -w miroir-store-filesystem -w miroir-store-indexedDb -w miroir-store-postgres
```

### Run Your First Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
npm run dev -w miroir-server

# Terminal 2: Start the client
npm run dev -w miroir-standalone-app
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and explore the Library example application!

<!-- ## Why Miroir?

### The Problem: Development Tools Are Fragmented

Modern development requires juggling dozens of tools and languages:

- editors (VS Code, VIM, Eclipse...) for coding
- Separate database design tools
- API testing tools (Postman, etc.)
- UI builders
- CI/CD pipelines
- Each with its own DSL and learning curve

### The Miroir Approach: Integration Inspired by Smalltalk

Miroir integrates development-time and runtime activities in a single environment:

- **Immediate Feedback** - Change your model, see results instantly without recompilation
- **Unified Model** - Define entities once, use in DB, API, UI, and business logic
- **Experimental Development** - Rapid prototyping with instant verification
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Detailing the Library App (Idealized)

This section gives a slightly simplified syntax for better understanding of the main features that constitute a Library Miroir application. See it for real in **[the Library Tutorial →](docs/tutorials/library-tutorial.md)**

### Define The Book Entity Model Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "definition": {
    "uuid": { "type": "uuid" },
    "title": { "type": "string" },
    "author": { "type": "uuid", "tag": { "value": { "defaultLabel": "Author", "targetEntity": "Author" } } },
    "isbn": { "type": "string", "optional": true },
    "publishedDate": { "type": "date" }
  }
}
```

### Query for the list of Books (Declarative)

```json
{
  "queryType": "extractorByEntityReturningObjectList",
  "targetEntity": "Book"
}
```

### Extract The Book Titles Only: Transform Data (Portable Logic)

```json
{
  "transformerType": "mapperListToList",
  "interpolation": "runtime",
  "referencedExtractor": "books",
  "orderBy": { "attributeName": "title" }
}
```

### Display Books in the UI: The BookList Report

```json
{
  "type": "list",
  "definition": {
    "entityUuid": "Book",
    "fetchQuery": { "queryReference": "booksQuery" }
  }
}
```

**Result**: A declarative, fully functional CRUD application with sorting, filtering, and relationships - no "code" required!

<!-- ## Architecture Highlights

### Layered Domain-Driven Design

```
0_interfaces/    → Core types and Jzod schemas
1_core/          → Foundation (tools, constants, domain state)
2_domain/        → Domain logic (selectors, transformers, templates)
3_controllers/   → Application controllers
4_services/      → Infrastructure (persistence stores)
4_views/         → UI layer (React components)
```

**Rule**: Dependencies flow downwards only. Implementation in layer 3 uses layers 2 & 1, but not vice versa.

### Multi-Workspace Monorepo

- **jzod** - JSON schema definition language
- **jzod-ts** - TypeScript type generation
- **miroir-core** - Framework foundation
- **miroir-localcache-redux** - Client-side state management
- **miroir-store-*** - Persistence adapters
- **miroir-react** - UI components
- **miroir-server** - Node.js backend
- **miroir-standalone-app** - Web application
- **miroir-mcp** - Model Context Protocol server
